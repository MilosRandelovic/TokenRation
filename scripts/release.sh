# Build, sign and publish TokenRation.app, then update the Homebrew cask's version and
# checksum. Run by CI on a version bump; also runnable locally.
#
# With a "Developer ID Application" certificate available the app is signed with the hardened
# runtime, notarized and stapled. Set ALLOW_UNSIGNED=1 to fall back to an ad-hoc build, which
# installs but is quarantined by Gatekeeper on first launch.
#
# Environment:
#   ALLOW_UNSIGNED  1 to allow an ad-hoc build when no certificate is present
#   SIGN_IDENTITY   signing identity to use instead of the first Developer ID found
#   NOTARY_PROFILE  stored notarytool credential profile (default: TokenRation-notary)
#   NOTARY_APPLE_ID, NOTARY_TEAM_ID, NOTARY_PASSWORD
#                   notary credentials, used instead of a stored profile
#   TAP_CASK        cask file to update (default: ../homebrew-tokenration/Casks/tokenration.rb)
#
# Signing prerequisites are documented in README.md.

  1. Create a GitHub release tagged v$SHORT_VERSION on MilosRandelovic/tokenration and
   upload $ZIP to it.
  2. Commit & push the updated cask in the homebrew-tokenration tap.
